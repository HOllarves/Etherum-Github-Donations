This project was built using Truffle and OpenZepelling for The School of AI's Descentralized Application course 2nd submission.

To run a local installation of truffle is required. You can download and install truffle following [these steps](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle).

In my case, I used Ganache for use of the internal testrpc. For different types of deployments, settings in `truffle.js` must be tweaked.

Run `truffle compile` and `truffle migrate` to push the contract to your blockchain of choice, and finally run `npm start` to start your local webserver that runs the react interface with truffle.

Look for your favorite developer in the community and make a donation. Otherwise, register yourself with your username, email and
github repository so other user can make donations to you.

## Warning

This is just an example. No oauth is implemented so anyone can register as anyone else. Again, this is just a homework assignment :).
